  "Description": "One of my first big Open Source projects was my Blazor SVG Editor. This project lets users edit SVG definitions in a graphical interface, all from Blazor. The users can edit and navigate existing SVGs from the editor using common user interactions like panning, zooming, translating, and scaling. They can likewise change details of the SVG elements that don\u0027t have a natural mapping and create new elements using an extensive context menu. I\u0027ve seen multiple projects that have used the project or parts of it to construct some cool interactive UIs. So I figured I wanted to make it possible for more people to use it by releasing it as a component library on NuGet. In this article, we will look at what features the Blazor SVG Editor NuGet package brings out of the box and how you can extend the functions of the base library to make your own interactive graphical tool.",
