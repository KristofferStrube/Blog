  "Description": "The NavigationManager is a service that enables developers to programmatically navigate the user to different pages or external URIs. In ASP.NET Core 7, there were added new features that enable us to parse simple state between pages and listen to and intercept navigation. In this post, we will look at the basic capabilities of the NavigationManager, present what new features were added in ASP.NET Core 7, discuss how it fits into the Blazor/.NET ecosystem, and in the end present a scenario that is now possible with relative ease using new additions from ASP.NET Core 7.",
