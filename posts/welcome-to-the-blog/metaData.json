  "Description": "I used to blog for the 4 years that I worked at elmah.io writing a lot about Blazor and .NET; Often in the format of some kind of tutorial or walk-along style article. I stopped my work there towards the end of 2021 as I began focusing on my other work as an instructor at that time. I have been thinking about blogging for others previously, but I feel like there is a lot of loops to get through for those as they of cause need to have a high level of quality. So, in this post I will introduce myself, show some of the projects that I have worked a lot with, and in the end talk about what I will blog about in the future.",
